		<img src="../images/frack2.jpg"/>
		<div class="articleText"><p>As protestors gather this week against the test oil drilling (known as hydraulic fracturing or, more hilariously, &#39;fracking&#39;) we&#39;re led to question what the frack are they going on about and why is this such an important environmental issue?</p>
<p><i>What&#39;s in a Frack?</i></p>
<p>Hydraulic fracturing or fracking is a process of recovering natural gas from shale rocks. A good fracking involves a large amount of heavy-drilling before injecting fluid 10,000ft into the ground at high pressure  through a drilled pipeline. At the end of the well, the higher pressures split nearby shale rocks, creating fissures which release natural gas into the well. This process has revolutionised fuel production in America, supposedly securing gas security for the nation for the next 100 years. With swathes of shale rock having been identified across the North of England, extraction of natural gas from these sources could act as a source of energy security for the UK. However, the over-exploitation of fracking witnessed in the US has led many to question the potential issues such methods may cause. </p> 
<p><i>What are the problems? </i></p>
<p>Well, firstly, fracking is far from an efficient process. Each fracturing requires between 1-8 million gallons of water plus 40,000 gallons of chemicals in the &#39;fracking fluid&#39;. This includes a huge number of various nasties such as carcinogenics, lead, mercury, and uranium. With such immense volumes of water and chemicals being used through the process, transportation costs reach staggering proportions, besides the additional environmental pollution produced. </p>
<p>Besides the volumes of chemicals being used, the process can be a potent source of contamination. Despite the cement casing around the well to prevent such leaks, methane gas and toxic chemicals may still leach into groundwater near the wells, even making its way into drinking water. In the US alone there have been over 1000 reported cases of respiratory, sensory, or neurological health problems as a direct result of drinking this contaminated water- not great news for those living near potential fracking sites. </p>
<p>Finally there is the issue of waste. Between 50-70% of the incredibly toxic non-biodegradable fluid is not recovered at the end of the process, and simply left in the ground. These left-overs are usually put in open vats for it to evaporate, where it releases harmful Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), contaminating the air, increasing ground level Ozone and causing acid rain. </p>
<p><i>So...what&#39;s the point?</i></p>
<p> Well besides all the input, pollution and waste the fracturing process does produce huge amounts of natural gas- up to 300,000 barrels a day from one well. Though many in favour have argued the benefits of shale gas reducing fuel costs, reports produced by Deutsche Bank, Chatham House and Ofgem all argue the opposite; showing arguments that shale gas will reduce fuel costs are far from concrete. The International Energy Agency has even forecast that natural gas prices will rise by 40 per cent by 2020, in spite of an influx of cheap supplies from shale. More importantly, environmentalists believe that fracking merely acts as a distraction from the development of sustainable renewable energy sources. &#34; Shale gas is not the solution to the UK&#39;s energy challenges, &#34;  said Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Tony Bosworth. &#34; We need a 21st century energy revolution based on efficiency and renewables, not more fossil fuels that will add to climate change. &#34;  The attraction of this new technology seem to have persuaded David Cameron yet, as protests continue this week, the general public remain unconvinced, leading us to question: </p>
<p>Should we be looking green for our energy production or is fracking the future? </p>
<p>Let&#39;s wait and see…</p>
